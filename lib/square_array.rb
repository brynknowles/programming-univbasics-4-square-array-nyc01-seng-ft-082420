# define a method called square_array
# iterate over each element in the array using a while loop
# square each element in the array
# return each element in the array in a new array
# use only while, arrays and other previously discussed methods for this solution

def square_array(array, number)
  counter = 0
  while array[counter] do
    puts array[counter]
    counter += 1
  end
